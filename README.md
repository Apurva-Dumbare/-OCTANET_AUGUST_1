# Self-Introductory Landing Page 
Welcome to the repository for my self-introductory landing page project! In this project, I've designed and developed a landing page using HTML and CSS to showcase my personal information, portfolio, and contact details.

The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and interactive landing page that provides information about me and my skills, as well as a way for visitors to get in touch with me. The landing page consists of the following sections:

# Technologies Used

HTML: Used for structuring the content of the page.

CSS: Used for styling and layout design.

# Special Thanks

I would like to extend a special thank you to Octanet for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project and learn more about web development.
